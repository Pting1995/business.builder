                Danielle is a Bay Area native and has had a passion for baking since her early years. She recalls baking around the holidays and giving treats out to family and friends while fantasizing of someday opening her own bakery. However, this remained merely a fantasy as her strict household dictated she follow a more traditional path leading her to study Economics at San Diego State.</p>

            <p> Upon graduating she moved back to the Bay Area where she finally decided to pursue her lifelong dream. She enrolled at Le Cordon Bleu and for the first time in her life was excited about school. Here she combined her newly found technical skills and real-world experience, externing at not one, but two, of the Bay Areaâ€™s top bakeries. </p>

            <p>At Spoonful of Sugar she learned modern wedding cake techniques while she credits her work under Jasmine Rae for helping her find her artistic and creative voice. </p>
